# JebsLang
JebsLang is a Java-based programing language that is made by calling functions/methods from the JebsLang template! You can use an already made Logger for debugging and easily create windows and elements using WindowManager!

### NON-COMMENT VERSION
If you've used JebsLang a lot, you're probably really annoyed that every single time you download a new JebsLang template, you have to delete a trillion comments explaining things going on. If you already know how things work and you don't need comments, you can get a comment-free version on my seperate JebsLang Github at https://github.com/JebsDeveloper/JebsLang-Comment-Free.
